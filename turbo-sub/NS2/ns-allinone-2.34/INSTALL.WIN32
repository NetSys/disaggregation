Neither ns-2 nor nam-1 is developed on (nor for) the win32 platform. 
However from ns release 2.26 and later, the package has been tested to 
build and validate under cygwin for win9X/2000/XP. Please see 
"Tips for building ns on windows" in the ns build page at 
http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/ns-build.html for detailed instructions to 
build ns in windows.
Also note that from ns-2.26 and later we do not test it to build/validate 
under windows using visual C++. 

Before you build, notice that you can get nam and ns binaries for windows at
http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/dist/binary/. If you only want to do tcl scripting in
ns, they were probably what you want.
