# These functions are needed by nam
# They are actually the functions used in the 'v' events in the nam traces
# The 'v' events are generated by dynamic links (rtmodel). Whenever you have 
# a nam trace which has dynamic link traces, you'll need to define the following 
# functions.

proc link-up {now src dst} {
	sim_annotation $now link($src:$dst) up
}

proc link-down {now src dst} {
	sim_annotation $now link($src:$dst) down

proc node-up {now src} {
	sim_annotation $now $node $src up
}

proc node-down {now src} {
	sim_annotation $now $node $src down
