/* MultipleFastRtx extension implements the Caro Multiple Fast Retransmit
 * Algorithm. Caro's Algorithm introduces a fastRtxRecover state variable
 * per TSN in the send buffer. Any time a TSN is retransmitted, its
 * fastRtxRecover is set to the highest TSN outstanding at the time of
 * retransmit. That way, only missing reports triggered by TSNs beyond
 * fastRtxRecover may trigger yet another fast retransmit.
