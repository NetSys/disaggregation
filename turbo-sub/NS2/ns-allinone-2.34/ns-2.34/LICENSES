The source files in NS contain a number of different copyrights and
software licenses from various individuals and institutions.  In 2005, 
the code base was relicensed to a collection of GNU GPL compatible, 
free software licenses.  See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html
for a collection of definitions of these terms.

Note:  See also the COPYRIGHTS file in this directory regarding the
copyrights on the ns-2 software.

The majority of software licenses use following types of licenses:
i) GNU GPL, with specific exception allowing the linking of the GPL
covered software with other software licensed with clauses in conflict with
the GPL (see below)
ii) original Berkeley-style licenses with advertising clauses
iii) modified Berkeley-style licenses (w/o advertising clause)

Other software licenses (e.g., Apache 2.0) also exist.

If you are considering the contribution of code to ns-2, please pick
a GNU GPL-compatible software license.  If you prefer GNU GPL, please
add the specific exception text listed below.

If you are considering the use of ns-2, consider that derivative
works or redistribution may be governed by the terms of the software
licenses used herein, including the GNU GPL and Berkeley-style
licenses with advertising clauses.
