ns ranvar.tcl demonstrates the use of the RandomVariable class in 
tcl.  the script doesn't perform and actual simulation.  rather, it
merely creates instances of the following kinds of random variables
and then generates a sequence of 10 random numbers from each:

Constant
Uniform
Exponential
Pareto
HyperExponential
