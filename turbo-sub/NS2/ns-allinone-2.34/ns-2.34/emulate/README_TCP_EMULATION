 To execute the ns emulation code 
 	make nse 
	Run scripts as root. 

 To originate a TCP connection from ns we need two machines. 
 To use tcpemu.tcl perform the following steps:
	- Perform the following steps on machine A 
		- Add a route to a dummy IP address assigned to ns TCP node using
			route add dummy_IP IP_where_nse_is_running
		- Disable IP redirects using
			sysctl -w net.inet.ip.redirect=0
		- start a tcp server application on some machine A
		( TCP Application provided at www-scf.usc.edu/~alefiyah/application/tcp-server.tar.gz ) 
	
	-Perform following steps on machine B
		- Disable IP forwarding using
			sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=0
		- Configure tcpemu.tcl with address and port for TCP server application 
		- run "nse tcpemu.tcl" 

To pass traffic through ns, we need three machines
Machine A with start a TCP connection with Machine B via machine C which has nse running. 
To use thrutcp.tcl perform the following steps:
	- Perform following steps on machine A and machine B 
		- Disable IP redirects
		- Disable IP forwarding 
	
	- On machine A, add route to machine B via machine C 
		route add B_IP C_IP

	- On machine B, add route to machine A via machine C
		route add A_IP C_IP

	- Configure the correct filters in thrutcp.tcl
	- run "nse thrutcp.tcl
	- Start any TCP application ( ie: ftp or rcp) between machines A and B
