 * Here is one set of parameters from one of my simulations:
 * 
 * ed [ q_weight=0.002 thresh=5 linterm=30 maxthresh=15
 *         mean_pktsize=500 dropmech=random-drop queue-size=60
 *         plot-file=none bytes=false doubleq=false dqthresh=50 
 *	   wait=true ]
 * 
 * 1/"linterm" is the max probability of dropping a packet. 
 * There are different options that make the code
 * more messy that it would otherwise be.  For example,
 * "doubleq" and "dqthresh" are for a queue that gives priority to
 *   small (control) packets, 
 * "bytes" indicates whether the queue should be measured in bytes 
 *   or in packets, 
 * "dropmech" indicates whether the drop function should be random-drop 
 *   or drop-tail when/if the queue overflows, and 
 *   the commented-out Holt-Winters method for computing the average queue 
 *   size can be ignored.
 * "wait" indicates whether the gateway should wait between dropping
 *   packets.
