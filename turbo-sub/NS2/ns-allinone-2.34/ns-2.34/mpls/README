Some Explaination of MPLS Code 

August 29, 2000

- MPLS CODE IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND IS NOT THOROUGHLY TESTED. YOU 
  SHOULD CAREFULLY VALIDATE IT FOR YOUR SPECIFIC USAGE. IF YOU FIND 
  ANY BUG, OR HAVE ANY PATCH, PLEASE SEND TO ns-users@isi.edu

- It does not work with multicast routing, particularly because (1)
  there is no label setup mechanism for multicast groups, (2) there is
  no multicast replicator to cooperate with MPLS classifier, and (3)
  MPLS header contain pointers, which do not work with multicast
  replicator.

- It works only with flat unicast routing but not hierarchical routing
  in any form. This is because current node-config architecture only
  provides exclusive node types, namely, a node cannot supports
  hierarchical routing and MPLS at the same time.
  
- Some interfaces in MPLS classifier and MPLS node are expected to
  change in the near future to accomodate a new design of node-config
  mechanism.

- There are no simple example files of MPLS code, because the ones in
  MPLS test suite are enough to serve as examples. Please read
  tcl/test/test-suite-mpls.tcl.
