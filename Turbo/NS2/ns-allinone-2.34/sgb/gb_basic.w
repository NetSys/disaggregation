\prerequisite{GB\_\,GRAPH}
@* Introduction. This GraphBase module contains six subroutines that generate
standard graphs of various types, together with six routines that combine or
transform existing graphs.

Simple examples of the use of these routines can be found in the
demonstration programs {\sc QUEEN} and {\sc QUEEN\_WRAP}.

@<gb_basic.h@>=
extern Graph *board(); /* moves on generalized chessboards */
extern Graph *simplex(); /* generalized triangular configurations */
extern Graph *subsets(); /* patterns of subset intersection */
extern Graph *perms(); /* permutations of a multiset */
extern Graph *parts(); /* partitions of an integer */
extern Graph *binary(); /* binary trees */
@#
extern Graph *complement(); /* the complement of a graph */
extern Graph *gunion(); /* the union of two graphs */
extern Graph *intersection(); /* the intersection of two graphs */
extern Graph *lines(); /* the line graph of a graph */
extern Graph *product(); /* the product of two graphs */
extern Graph *induced(); /* a graph induced from another */

@ The \CEE/ file \.{gb\_basic.c} has the following overall shape:

@p
#include "gb_graph.h" /* we use the {\sc GB\_\,GRAPH} data structures */
@h@#
@<Private variables@>@;
@<Basic subroutines@>@;
@<Applications of basic subroutines@>@;

@ Several of the programs below allocate arrays that will be freed again
before the routine is finished.

@<Private variables@>=
static Area working_storage;

@ If a graph-generating subroutine encounters a problem, it returns |NULL|
(that is, \.{NULL}), after putting a code number into the external variable
|panic_code|. This code number identifies the type of failure.
Otherwise the routine returns a pointer to the newly created graph, which
will be represented with the data structures explained in {\sc GB\_\,GRAPH}.
(The external variable |panic_code| is itself defined in {\sc GB\_\,GRAPH}.)

@d panic(c) 
  {@+panic_code=c;
    gb_free(working_storage);
    gb_trouble_code=0;
    return NULL;
  }

@ The names of vertices are sometimes formed from the names of other
vertices, or from potentially long sequences of numbers. We assemble
them in the |buffer| array, which is sufficiently long that the
vast majority of applications will be unconstrained by size limitations.
The programs assume that |BUF_SIZE| is rather large, but in cases of
doubt they ensure that |BUF_SIZE| will never be exceeded.

@d BUF_SIZE 4096

@<Private v...@>=
static char buffer[BUF_SIZE];

@*Grids and game boards. The subroutine call
|board(n1,n2,n3,n4,piece,wrap,directed)|
constructs a graph based on the moves of generalized chesspieces on a
generalized rectangular board. Each vertex of the graph corresponds to a
position on the board. Each arc of the graph corresponds to a move from
one position to another.

The first parameters, |n1| through |n4|, specify the size of the board.
If, for example, a two-dimensional board with $n_1$ rows and $n_2$ columns
is desired, you set $|n1|=n_1$, $|n2|=n_2$, and $|n3|=0$; the resulting
graph will have $n_1n_2$ vertices. If you want a three-dimensional
board with $n_3$ layers, set $|n3|=n_3$ and $n_4=0$. If you want
a 4-{\mc D} board, put the number of 4th coordinates in~|n4|.
If you want a $d$-dimensional board with $2^d$ positions, set |n1=2|
and |n2=-d|.

In general, the |board| subroutine determines the dimensions by scanning the
sequence |(n1,n2,n3,n4,0)=@t$(n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4,0)$@>| from left to right
until coming to the first nonpositive parameter $n_{k+1}$. If $k=0$
(i.e., if |n1<=0|), the default size $8\times8$ will be used; this is
an ordinary chessboard with 8~rows and 8~columns. Otherwise if $n_{k+1}=0$,
the board will have $k$~dimensions $n_1$, \dots,~$n_k$. Otherwise
we must have $n_{k+1}<0$; in this case, the board will have $d=\vert n_{k+1}
\vert$ dimensions, chosen as the first $d$ elements of the infinite
periodic sequence $(n_1,\ldots,n_k,n_1,\ldots,n_k,n_1,\ldots\,)$.
For example, the specification |(n1,n2,n3,n4)=(2,3,5,-7)| is about as
tricky as you can get. It produces a seven-dimensional board with
dimensions $(n_1,\ldots,n_7)=(2,3,5,2,3,5,2)$, hence a graph with
$2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot2=1800$ vertices.

The |piece| parameter specifies the legal moves of a generalized chesspiece.
If |piece>0|, a move from position~|u| to position~|v| is considered legal
if and only if the Euclidean distance between points |u| and~|v| is
equal to $\sqrt{\vphantom1\smash{|piece|}}$.
For example, if |piece=1| and if we have a
two-dimensional board, the legal moves from $(x,y)$ are to $(x,y\pm1)$ and
$(x\pm1,y)$; these are the moves of a so-called wazir, the only moves that
a king and a rook can both make. If |piece=2|, the legal moves from $(x,y)$
are to $(x\pm1,y\pm1)$; these are the four moves that a king and a bishop
can both make. (A piece that can make only these moves was called a ``fers''
in ancient Muslim chess.) If |piece=5|, the legal moves are those of a
knight, from $(x,y)$ to $(x\pm1,y\pm2)$ or to $(x\pm2,y\pm1)$. If |piece=3|,
there are no legal moves on a two-dimensional board; but moves from
$(x,y,z)$ to $(x\pm1,y\pm1,z\pm1)$ would be legal in three dimensions.
If |piece=0|, it is changed to the default value |piece=1|.

If the value of |piece| is negative, arbitrary multiples of the basic moves
for $\vert|piece|\vert$ are permitted. For example, |piece=-1| defines the
moves of a rook, from $(x,y)$ to $(x\pm a,y)$ or to $(x,y\pm a)$ for all
$a>0$; |piece=-2| defines the moves of a bishop, from $(x,y)$ to
$(x\pm a,y\pm a)$. The literature of ``fairy chess'' assigns standard names
to the following |piece| values: $\rm wazir=1$, $\rm fers=2$, $\rm dabbaba=4$,
$\rm knight=5$, $\rm alfil=8$, $\rm camel=10$, $\rm zebra=13$, $\rm giraffe
=17$, $\rm fiveleaper=25$, $\hbox{root-50-leaper}=50$, etc.; $\rm rook=-1$,
$\rm bishop=-2$, $\rm unicorn=-3$, $\rm dabbabarider=-4$, $\rm nightrider=-5$,
$\rm alfilrider=-8$, $\rm camelrider=-10$, etc.

To generate a board with the moves of a king, you can use the |gunion|
subroutine below to take the union of boards with |piece=1| and
|piece=2|. Similarly, you can get queen moves by taking the union of
boards with |piece=-1| and |piece=-2|.

If |piece>0|, all arcs of the graph will have length~1. If |piece<0|, the
length of each arc will be the number of multiples of a basic move that
produced the arc.

@ If the |wrap| parameter is nonzero, it specifies a subset of coordinates
in which values are computed modulo the corresponding size.
For example, the coordinates $(x,y)$ for vertices on a two-dimensional
board are restricted to the range $0\le x<n_1$, $0\le y<n_2$; therefore
when |wrap=0|, a move from $(x,y)$ to $(x+\delta_1,y+\delta_2)$ is
legal only if $0\le x+\delta_1<n_1$ and $0\le y+\delta_2<n_2$.
But when |wrap=1|, the $x$~coordinates are allowed to ``wrap around'';
the move would then be made to $((x+\delta_1)\bmod n_1,y+\delta_2)$,
provided that $0\le y+\delta_2<n_2$. Setting |wrap=1| effectively
makes the board into a cylinder instead of a rectangle. Similarly, the
$y$~coordinates are allowed to wrap around when |wrap=2|. Both $x$ and
$y$ coordinates are treated modulo their corresponding sizes when
|wrap=3|; the board is then effectively a torus.  In general,
coordinates $k_1$, $k_2$, \dots~ will wrap around when
$|wrap|=2^{k_1-1}+2^{k_2-1}+\cdots\,$. Setting |wrap=-1| causes all
coordinates to be computed modulo their size.

The graph constructed by |board| will be undirected unless |directed!=0|.
Directed |board| graphs will be acyclic when |wrap=0|, but they may
have cycles when |wrap!=0|. Precise rules defining the directed arcs
are given below.

Several important special cases are worth noting. To get the complete graph
on |n| vertices, you can say |board(n,0,0,0,-1,0,0)|. To get the
transitive tournament on |n| vertices, i.e., the directed graph
with arcs from |u| to |v| when |u<v|, you can say |board(n,0,0,0,-1,0,1)|.
To get the empty graph on |n| vertices, you can say |board(n,0,0,0,2,0,0)|.
To get a circuit (undirected) or a cycle (directed) of length~|n|,
you can say |board(n,0,0,0,1,1,0)| and |board(n,0,0,0,1,1,1)|,
respectively.

@ Most of the subroutines in {\sc GB\_\,BASIC} use the following local
variables.

@<Vanilla local variables@>=
Graph *new_graph; /* the graph being constructed */
register long i,j,k; /* all-purpose indices */
register long d; /* the number of dimensions */
register Vertex *v; /* the current vertex of interest */
register long s; /* accumulator */

@ Several arrays will facilitate the calculations that |board| needs to make.
The number of distinct values in coordinate position~$k$ will be |nn[k]|;
this coordinate position will wrap around if and only if |wr[k]!=0|.
The current moves under consideration will be from $(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$
to $(x_1+\delta_1,\ldots, x_k+\delta_k)$, where $\delta_k$ is stored
in |del[k]|. An auxiliary array |sig| holds the sums
$\sigma_k=\delta_1^2+\cdots+\delta_{k-1}^2$.  Additional arrays |xx|
and |yy| hold coordinates of vertices before and after a move is made.

Some of these arrays are also used for other purposes by other programs
besides |board|; we will meet those programs later.

We limit the number of dimensions to 91 or less. This is hardly a limitation,
since the number of vertices would be astronomical even if the dimensionality
were only half this big. But some of our later programs will be able
to make good use of 40 or 50 dimensions and perhaps more; the number 91
is an upper limit imposed by the number of standard printable characters
(see the convention for vertex names in the |perms| routine).

@ The symbolic name of a board position like $(3,1)$ will be the string
`\.{3.1}'. The first three coordinates are also stored as integers, in
utility fields |x.I|, |y.I|, and |z.I|, because immediate access to
those values will be helpful in certain applications. (The coordinates can,
of course, always be recovered in a slower fashion from the vertex name,
via |sscanf|.)

The process of assigning coordinate values and names is equivalent to
adding unity in a mixed-radix number system. Vertex $(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$
will be in position $x_1n_2\ldots n_d+\cdots+x_{d-1}n_d+x_d$ relative
to the first vertex of the new graph; therefore it is also possible to
deduce the coordinates of a vertex from its address.

@ Now we come to a slightly tricky part of the routine: the move generator.
Let $p=\vert|piece|\vert$. The outer loop of this procedure runs through all
solutions of the equation $\delta_1^2+\cdots+\delta_d^2=p$, where the
$\delta$'s are nonnegative integers. Within that loop, we attach signs
to the $\delta$'s, but we always leave $\delta_k$ positive if $\delta_1=
\cdots=\delta_{k-1}=0$. For every such vector~$\delta$, we generate moves
from |v| to $v+\delta$ for every vertex |v|. When |directed=0|,
we use |gb_new_edge| instead of |gb_new_arc|, so that the reverse arc
from $v+\delta$ to~|v| is also generated.

@ The \CEE/ language does not define |>>| unambiguously. If |w| is negative,
the assignment `|w>>=1|' here should keep |w| negative.

@ The legal moves when |piece| is negative are derived as follows, in
the presence of possible wraparound: Starting at $(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$, we
move to $(x_1+\delta_1,\ldots,x_d+\delta_d)$, $(x_1+2\delta_1,\ldots,
x_d+2\delta_d)$,~\dots, until either coming to a position with a nonwrapped
coordinate out of range or coming back to the original point.

A subtle technicality should be noted: When coordinates are wrapped and
|piece>0|, self-loops are possible---for example, in |board(1,0,0,0,1,1,1)|.
But self-loops never arise when |piece<0|.

@* Generalized triangular boards. The subroutine call
|simplex(n,n0,n1,n2,n3,n4,directed)| creates a graph based on
generalized triangular or tetrahedral configurations. Such graphs are
similar in spirit to the game boards created by |board|, but they
pertain to nonrectangular grids like those in Chinese checkers. As
with |board| in the case |piece=1|, the vertices represent board positions
and the arcs run from board positions to their nearest neighbors. Each arc has
length~1.{\tolerance=1000\par}

More formally, the vertices can be defined as sequences of nonnegative
integers $(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ whose sum is~|n|, where two sequences
are considered adjacent if and only if they differ by $\pm1$ in exactly
two components---equivalently, if the Euclidean distance between them
is~$\sqrt2$. When $d=2$, for example, the vertices can be visualized
as a triangular array
$$\vcenter{\halign{&\hbox to 2em{\hss$#$\hss}\cr
&&&(0,0,3)\cr
&&(0,1,2)&&(1,0,2)\cr
&(0,2,1)&&(1,1,1)&&(2,0,1)\cr
(0,3,0)&&(1,2,0)&&(2,1,0)&&(3,0,0)\cr}}$$
containing $(n+1)(n+2)/2$ elements, illustrated here when $n=3$; each vertex of
the array has up to 6 neighbors. When $d=3$ the vertices form a tetrahedral
array, a stack of triangular layers, and they can have as many as 12
neighbors. In general, a vertex in a $d$-simplicial array will have up to
$d(d+1)$ neighbors.

If the |directed| parameter is nonzero, arcs run only from vertices to
neighbors that are lexicographically greater---for example, downward
or to the right in the triangular array shown. The directed graph is
therefore acyclic, and a vertex of a $d$-simplicial array has
out-degree at most $d(d+1)/2$.

@ The first parameter, |n|, specifies the sum of the coordinates
$(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_d)$. The following parameters |n0| through |n4|
specify upper bounds on those coordinates, and they also specify the
dimensionality~|d|.

If, for example, |n0|, |n1|, and |n2| are positive while |n3=0|, the
value of~|d| will be~2 and the coordinates will be constrained to
satisfy $0\le x_0\le|n0|$, $0\le x_1\le|n1|$, $0\le x_2\le|n2|$. These
upper bounds essentially lop off the corners of the triangular array.
We obtain a hexagonal board with $6m$ boundary cells by asking for
|simplex(3m,2m,2m,2m,0,0,0)|. We obtain the diamond-shaped board used
in the game of Hex [Martin Gardner, {\sl The Scientific American
@^Gardner, Martin@>
Book of Mathematical Puzzles {\char`\&} Diversions\/} (Simon {\char`\&}
Schuster, 1959), Chapter~8] by calling |simplex(20,10,20,10,0,0,0)|.

In general, |simplex| determines |d| and upper bounds $(n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_d)$
in the following way: Let the first nonpositive entry of the sequence
|(n0,n1,n2,n3,n4,0)|$\null=(n_0,n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4,0)$ be~$n_k$. If $k>0$
and $n_k=0$, the value of~$d$ will be $k-1$ and the coordinates will be
bounded by the given numbers $(n_0,\ldots,n_d)$. If $k>0$ and $n_k<0$,
the value of~$d$ will be $\vert n_k\vert$ and the coordinates will be
bounded by the first $d+1$ elements of the infinite periodic sequence
$(n_0,\ldots,n_{k-1},n_0,\ldots,n_{k-1},n_0,\ldots\,)$. If $k=0$ and
$n_0<0$, the value of~$d$ will be $\vert n_0\vert$ and the coordinates
will be unbounded; equivalently, we may set $n_0=\cdots=n_d=n$. In
this case the number of vertices will be $n+d\choose d$. Finally,
if $k=0$ and $n_0=0$, we have the default case of a triangular array
with $3n$ boundary cells, exactly as if $n_0=-2$.

For example, the specification |n0=3|, |n1=-5| will produce all vertices
$(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_5)$ such that $x_0+x_1+\cdots+x_5=n$ and $0\le x_j\le3$.
The specification |n0=1|, |n1=-d| will essentially produce all $n$-element
subsets of the $(d+1)$-element set $\{0,1,\ldots,d\}$, because we can
regard an element~$k$ as being present in the set if $x_k=1$ and absent
if $x_k=0$. In that case two subsets are adjacent if and only if
they have exactly $n-1$ elements in common.

@* Subset graphs. The subroutine call {\advance\thinmuskip 0mu plus 2mu
|subsets(n,n0,n1,n2,n3,n4,size_bits,directed)|}
creates a graph having the same vertices as
|simplex(n,n0,n1,n2,n3,n4,directed)| but with a quite different notion
of adjacency. In this we interpret a solution $(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ to
the conditions $x_0+x_1+\cdots+x_d=n$ and $0\le x_j\le n_j$ not as a
position on a game board but as an $n$-element submultiset of the multiset
$\{n_0\cdot0,n_1\cdot 1,\ldots,n_d\cdot d\}$ that has $x_j$ elements
equal to~$j$. (If each $n_j=1$, the multiset is a set; this is an
important special case.) Two vertices are adjacent if and only if
their intersection has a cardinality that matches one of the bits in
|size_bits|, which is an unsigned integer. Each arc has length~1.

For example, suppose $n=3$ and |(n0,n1,n2,n3)=(2,2,2,0)|. Then the vertices
are the 3-element submultisets of $\{0,0,1,1,2,2\}$, namely
$$\{0,0,1\},\quad \{0,0,2\},\quad \{0,1,2\},\quad
\{0,2,2\},\quad \{1,1,2\},\quad \{1,2,2\},$$
which are represented by the respective vectors
$$(2,1,0),\quad (2,0,1),\quad (1,1,1),\quad
(1,0,2),\quad (0,2,1),\quad (0,1,2).$$
The intersection of multisets represented by $(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ and
$(y_0,y_1,\ldots,y_d)$ is $$\bigl(\min(x_0,y_0),\min(x_1,y_1),\ldots,
\min(x_d,y_d)\bigr);$$ each element occurs as often as it occurs
in both multisets being intersected. If now |size_bits=3|, the
multisets will be considered adjacent whenever their
intersection contains exactly 0 or~1 elements, because $3=2^0+2^1$.
The vertices adjacent to $\{0,0,1\}$, for example, will be
$\{0,2,2\}$ and $\{1,2,2\}$. In this case, every pair of submultisets
has a nonempty intersection, so the same graph would be obtained
if |size_bits=2|.

If |directed| is nonzero, the graph will have directed arcs, from |u|
to~|v| only if $u\le v$. Notice that the graph will have self-loops if
and only if the binary representation of |size_bits| contains the term
$2^n$, in which case there will be a loop from every vertex to itself.
(In an undirected graph, such loops are represented by two arcs.)

We define a macro |disjoint_subsets(n,k)| for the case
of $n\choose k$ vertices, adjacent if and only if they represent
disjoint $k$-subsets of an $n$-set.
One important special case is the Petersen graph, whose vertices
@^Petersen, Julius Peter Christian, graph@>
are the 2-element subsets of $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$, adjacent when they
are disjoint. This graph is remarkable because it contains 10 vertices,
each of degree~3, but it has no circuits of length less than~5.

@* Permutation graphs. The subroutine call
|perms(n0,n1,n2,n3,n4,max_inv,directed)|
creates a graph whose vertices represent the permutations of a
multiset that have at most |max_inv| inversions. Two permutations are adjacent
in the graph if one is obtained from the other by interchanging two
adjacent elements. Each arc has length~1.

For example, the multiset $\{0,0,1,2\}$ has the following twelve permutations:
$$\vcenter{\halign{#&&\quad#\cr
0012,&0021,&0102,&0120,&0201,&0210,\cr
1002,&1020,&1200,&2001,&2010,&2100.\cr}}$$
The first of these, 0012, has two neighbors, 0021 and 0102.

The number of inversions is the number of pairs of elements $xy$ such
that $x>y$ and $x$ precedes $y$ from left to right, counting
multiplicity.  For example, 2010 has four inversions, corresponding to
$xy\in\{20,21,20,10\}$. It is not difficult to verify that the number
of inversions of a permutation is the distance in the graph from that
permutation to the lexicographically first permutation.

Parameters |n0| through |n4| specify the composition of the multiset,
just as in the |subsets| routine.
Roughly speaking, there are |n0| elements equal to~0, |n1| elements
equal to~1, and so on. The multiset $\{0,0,1,2,3,3\}$, for example, would
be represented by |(n0,n1,n2,n3,n4)=(2,1,1,2,0)|.

Of course, we sometimes want to have multisets with more than five distinct
elements; when there are $d+1$ distinct elements, the multiset should have
$n_k$ elements equal to~$k$ and $n=n_0+n_1+\cdots+n_d$ elements in all.
Larger values of $d$ can be specified by using |-d| as a parameter:
If |n0=-d|, each multiplicity $n_k$ is taken to be~1; if |n0>0| and |n1=-d|,
each multiplicity $n_k$ is taken to be equal to~|n0|;
if |n0>0|, |n1>0|, and |n2=-d|, the multiplicities are alternately
$(|n0|,|n1|,|n0|,|n1|,|n0|,\ldots\,)$; if  |n0>0|, |n1>0|, |n2>0|, and
|n3=-d|, the multiplicities are the first~|d+1| elements of the
periodic sequence $(|n0|,|n1|,|n2|,|n0|,|n1|,\ldots\,)$; and if all
but |n4| are positive, while |n4=-d|, the multiplicities again
are periodic.

An example like |(n0,n1,n2,n3,n4)=(1,2,3,4,-8)| is about as tricky
as you can get. It specifies the multiset $\{0,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5,5,
6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8\}$.

If any of the multiplicity parameters is negative or zero, the
remaining multiplicities are ignored. For example, if |n2<=0|, the
subroutine does not look at |n3| or~|n4|.

You probably don't want to try |perms(n0,0,0,0,0,max_inv,directed)|
when |n0>0|, because a multiset with |n0| identical elements has only
one permutation.

The special case when you want all $n!$ permutations of an $n$-element set
can be obtained by calling |all_perms(n,directed)|.

@(gb_basic.h@>=
#define all_perms(n,directed) @[perms((long)(1-(n)),0L,0L,0L,0L,0L,\
   (long)(directed))@]

@ If |max_inv=0|, all permutations will be considered, regardless of
the number of inversions. In that case the total number of vertices in
the graph will be the multinomial coefficient $${n\choose
n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_d}\,,\qquad n=n_0+n_1+\cdots+n_d.$$ The maximum
number of inversions in general is the number of inversions of the
lexicographically last permutation, namely ${n\choose2}-{n_0\choose2}-
{n_1\choose2}-\cdots-{n_d\choose2}=\sum_{0\le j<k\le d}n_jn_k$.

\vskip1pt
Notice that in the case $d=1$, we essentially obtain all combinations of
|n0+n1| elements taken |n1| at a time. The positions of the 1's correspond
to the elements of a subset or sample.

If |directed| is nonzero, the graph will contain only directed arcs
from permutations to neighboring permutations that have exactly one more
inversion. In this case the graph corresponds to a partial ordering that is a
lattice with interesting properties; see the article by Bennett and Birkhoff

@ As we generate the permutations, we maintain a table $(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$,

$(2,0,1,0)$, the inversion table is $(y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4)=(0,0,1,3)$. Clearly
$0\le y_k<k$, and $y_k\le y_{k-1}$ when the $k$th element of the multiset
is the same as the $(k-1)$st element. These conditions are necessary

such that $y_k$ can legitimately be increased by~1. When we encounter
a~$k$ for which $y_k$ cannot be increased, we set $y_k=0$ and adjust
the $x$'s accordingly. If no $y_k$ can be increased, we are done.

@* Partition graphs. The subroutine call
|parts(n,max_parts,max_size,directed)|
creates a graph whose vertices represent the different ways to partition
the integer~|n| into at most |max_parts| parts, where each part is at most
|max_size|. Two partitions are adjacent in the graph if
one can be obtained from the other by combining two parts.
Each arc has length~1.

For example, the partitions of~5 are
$$5,\quad 4+1,\quad 3+2,\quad 3+1+1,\quad 2+2+1,
       \quad 2+1+1+1,\quad 1+1+1+1+1.$$
Here 5 is adjacent to $4+1$ and to $3+2$; $4+1$ is adjacent also to
$3+1+1$ and to $2+2+1$; $3+2$ is adjacent also to $3+1+1$ and to $2+2+1$; etc.
If |max_size| is 3, the partitions 5 and $4+1$ would not be included in
the graph. If |max_parts| is 3, the partitions $2+1+1+1$ and $1+1+1+1+1$
would not be included.

If |max_parts| or |max_size| are zero, they are reset to be equal to~|n|
so that they make no restriction on the partitions.

If |directed| is nonzero, the graph will contain only directed arcs from
partitions to their neighbors that have exactly one more part.

The special case when we want to generate all $p(n)$ partitions of the
integer~$n$ can be obtained by calling |all_parts(n,directed)|.

@* Binary tree graphs. The subroutine call
|binary(n,max_height,directed)|
creates a graph whose vertices represent the binary trees with $n$ internal
nodes and with all leaves at a distance that is at most |max_height|
from the root. Two binary trees are adjacent in the graph if
one can be obtained from the other by a single application of the
associative law for binary operations, i.e., by replacing some subtree
of the form $(\alpha\cdot\beta)\cdot\gamma$ by the subtree $\alpha\cdot
(\beta\cdot\gamma)$. (This transformation on binary trees is often
called a ``rotation.'') If the |directed| parameter is nonzero, the
directed arcs go from a tree containing $(\alpha\cdot\beta)\cdot\gamma$
to a tree containing $\alpha\cdot(\beta\cdot\gamma)$ in its place; otherwise
the graph is undirected. Each arc has length~1.

For example, the binary trees with three internal nodes form a circuit of
length~5. They are
$$\mathcode`.="2201 % \cdot
(a.b).(c.d),\quad a.(b.(c.d)),\quad a.((b.c).d),\quad (a.(b.c)).d,\quad
((a.b).c).d,$$
if we use infix notation and name the leaves $(a,b,c,d)$ from left to right.
Here each tree is related to its two neighbors by associativity. The
first and last trees are also related in the same way.

If |max_height=0|, it is changed to |n|, which means there is no
restriction on the height of a leaf. In this case the graph will have
exactly ${2n+1\choose n}/ (2n+1)$ vertices; furthermore, each vertex
will have exactly $n-1$ neighbors, because a rotation will be possible
just above every internal node except the root.  The graph in this
case can also be interpreted geometrically: The vertices are in
one-to-one correspondence with the triangulations of a regular
$(n+2)$-gon; two triangulations are adjacent if and only if one is obtained
from the other by replacing the pair of adjacent triangles $ABC,DCB$
by the pair $ADC,BDA$.

The partial ordering corresponding to the directed graph on
${2n+1\choose n}/(2n+1)$ vertices created by |all_trees(n,1)|
is a lattice with interesting properties. See Huang and Tamari,

coefficients of $G_6$ are much larger; they exceed one billion when
$28\le n\le49$, and they exceed one million when $17\le n\le 56$.
In order to avoid overflow during this calculation, we use a
special method when $h\ge6$ and $n\ge20$: In such cases, graphs
of reasonable size arise only if $n\ge 2^h-7$, and we look at the
coefficient of $z^{-(2^h-1-n)}$ in $R_h=G_h/z^{2^h-1}$, which is a
power series in $z^{-1}$ defined by the recurrence
$$R_0=1,\qquad R_{h+1}=R_h^2+z^{1-2^{h+1}}.$$

@ We generate the trees in lexicographic order of their Polish prefix
notation, encoded in binary notation as $x_0x_1\ldots x_{2n}$, using `1'
for an internal node and `0' for a leaf. For example, the five
trees when $n=3$ are
$$1010100,\quad 1011000,\quad 1100100,\quad 1101000,\quad 1110000,$$
in lexicographic order. The algorithm for lexicographic generation maintains
three auxiliary arrays $l_j$, $y_j$, and $\sigma_j$, where
$$\sigma_j\;=\;n-j+\sum_{i=0}^{j-1}x_i\;=\;-1+\sum_{i=j}^{2n}(1-x_i)$$
is one less than the number of 0's (leaves) in $(x_j,\ldots,x_{2n})$.
The values of $l_j$ and $y_j$ are harder
to describe formally; $l_j$ is $2^{h-l}$ when $h=|max_height|$ and when
$x_j$ represents a node at level~$l$ of the tree, based on the values
of $(x_0,\ldots,x_{j-1})$. The value of $y_j$ is a binary encoding of
tree levels in which an internal node has not yet received a right child;
$y_j$ is also the maximum number of future leaves that can be produced by
previously specified internal nodes without exceeding the maximum height.
The number of 1-bits in $y_j$ is the minimum number of future leaves,
based on previous specifications.

Therefore if $\sigma_j>y_j$, $x_j$ is forced to be~1. If $l_j=1$,
$x_j$ is forced to be~0. If the number of 1-bits of $y_j$ is equal
to $\sigma_j$, $x_j$ is forced to be~0. Otherwise $x_j$ can be
either 0 or~1, and it will be possible to complete the partial
solution $x_0\ldots x_j$ to a full Polish prefix code $x_0\ldots x_{2n}$.

For example, here are the arrays for one of the binary trees
that is generated when $n=h=3$:
$$\vcenter{\halign{$\hfil#$\quad=&&\quad#\cr
j       &0&1&2&3&4&5&6\cr
l_j     &8&4&2&2&1&1&4\cr
y_j     &0&4&6&4&5&4&0\cr
\sigma_j&3&3&3&2&2&1&0\cr
x_j     &1&1&0&1&0&0&0\cr}}$$
If $x_j=1$ and $j<2n$, we have $l_{j+1}=l_j/2$, $y_{j+1}=y_j+l_{j+1}$,
and $\sigma_{j+1}=\sigma_j$. If $x_j=0$ and $j<2n$, we have $l_{j+1}=
2^t$, $y_{j+1}=y_j-2^t$, and $\sigma_{j+1}=\sigma_j-1$, where $2^t$ is the
least power of~2 in the binary representation of~$y_j$. It is not difficult to
prove by induction that $\sigma_j<y_j+l_j$, assuming that $n<2^h$.

graphs into new ones, thereby presenting us with an almost
mind-boggling array of further possibilities.

The first of these transformations is perhaps the simplest. It
complements a given graph, making vertices adjacent if and only if
they were previously nonadjacent. More precisely, the subroutine call
|complement(g,copy,self,directed)| returns a graph with the
same vertices as |g|, but with complemented arcs.
If |self!=0|, the new graph will have a self-loop from a vertex |v| to itself
when the original graph did not; if |self=0|, the new graph will
have no self-loops. If |directed!=0|, the new graph will have
an arc from |u| to |v| when the original graph did not; if |directed=0|,
the new graph will be undirected, and it will have an edge between |u|
and~|v| when the original graph did not. In the latter case, the original
graph should also be undirected (that is, its arcs should come in pairs,
as described in the |gb_new_edge| routine of {\sc GB\_\,GRAPH}).

If |copy!=0|, a double complement will actually be done. This means that
the new graph will essentially be a copy of the old, except that
duplicate arcs (and possibly self-loops) will be removed. Regardless of
the value of |copy|, information that might have been present in the utility
fields will not be copied, and arc lengths will all be set to~1.

One possibly useful feature of the graphs returned by |complement| is
worth noting. The vertices adjacent to~|v|, namely the list
$$\hbox{|v->arcs->tip|,\quad |v->arcs->next->tip|,\quad
 |v->arcs->next->next->tip|,\quad \dots\thinspace,}$$
will be in strictly decreasing order (except in the case of an
undirected self-loop, when |v| itself will appear twice in succession).

fact that the vertices of a graph being copied are a constant distance away

for (u=new_graph->vertices,v=g->vertices;v<g->vertices+n;u++,v++)
  u->name=gb_save_string(v->name);

@ A temporary utility field in the new graph is used to remember which
vertices are adjacent to a given vertex in the old one. We stamp the |tmp|
field of~|v| with a pointer to~|u| when there's an arc from |u| to~|v|.

        gb_new_edge(u,vv,1L);
  }
}
for (v=new_graph->vertices;v<new_graph->vertices+n;v++) v->tmp=NULL;

@* Graph union and intersection. Another simple way to get new graphs
from old ones is to take the union or intersection of their sets of arcs. The
subroutine call |gunion(g,gg,multi,directed)| produces a graph
with the vertices and arcs of |g| together with the
arcs of another graph~|gg|. The subroutine call |intersection(g,gg,multi,
directed)| produces a graph with the vertices of |g| but with only the
arcs that appear in both |g| and |gg|. In both cases we assume
that |gg| has the same vertices as |g|, in the sense that vertices
in the same relative position from the beginning of the vertex array
are considered identical. If the actual number of vertices in |gg| exceeds
the number in |g|, the extra vertices and all arcs touching them in~|gg| are
suppressed.

The input graphs are assumed to be undirected, unless the |directed|
parameter is nonzero. Peculiar results might occur if you mix directed
and undirected graphs, but the subroutines will not ``crash''
when they are asked to produce undirected output from directed input.

If |multi| is nonzero, the new graph may have multiple edges: Suppose
there are $k_1$ arcs from $u$ to $v$ in |g| and $k_2$ such arcs in |gg|. Then
there will be $k_1+k_2$ in the union and $\min(k_1,k_2)$ in the
intersection when |multi!=0|, but at most
one in the union or intersection when |multi=0|.

The lengths of arcs are copied to the union graph when |multi!=0|;
the minimum length of multiple arcs is retained in the union when |multi=0|.

The lengths of arcs in the intersection graph are a bit trickier.
If multiple arcs occur in |g|, their minimum length, |l|, is computed. Then
we compute the maximum of |l| and the lengths of corresponding arcs
in |gg|. If |multi=0|, only the minimum of those maxima will survive.

@ We use the |tmp| trick of |complement| to remember which arcs have

minimum lengths. Namely, |uu->tmp| will equal |u| if and only

will be one such arc. In the undirected case, |uu->tlen| will point to the
first arc of an edge pair that touches~|u|.

The only thing slightly nontrivial here is the way we keep undirected
edges grouped in pairs. We generate a new edge from |vv| to |u| only
if |vv<=u|, and if equality holds we advance~|a| so that we don't
see the self-loop in both directions. Similar logic will be repeated

@* Line graphs. The next operation in {\sc GB\_\,BASIC}'s repertoire constructs
the so-called line graph of a given graph~$g$. The subroutine that does
this is invoked by calling `|lines(g,directed)|'.

If |directed=0|, the line graph has one vertex for each edge of~|g|;
two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding edges
have a common vertex.

If |directed!=0|, the line graph has one vertex for each arc of~|g|;
there is an arc from vertex |u| to vertex |v| if and only if the
arc corresponding to~|u| ends at the vertex that begins the arc
corresponding to~|v|.

All arcs of the line graph will have length~1.

Utility fields |u.V| and |v.V| of each vertex in the line graph will point to
the vertices of |g| that define the corresponding arc or edge, and |w.A| will
point to the arc from |u.V| to |v.V| in~|g|. In the undirected case we will
have |u.V<=v.V|.

@ We want to add a data structure to |g| so that the line graph can be
built efficiently. But we also want to preserve |g| so that it
exhibits no traces of occupation when |lines| has finished its
work.  To do this, we will move utility field~|v->z| temporarily into
a utility field~|u->z| of the line graph, where |u| is the first
vertex having |u->u.V==v|, whenever such a |u| exists. Then we'll
set |v->map=u|. We will then be able to find |u| when |v|
is given, and we'll be able to cover our tracks later.

In the undirected case, further structure is needed. We will temporarily
change the |tip| field in the second arc of each edge pair so that
it points to the line-graph vertex that points to the first arc of the pair.

The |util_types| field of the graph does not indicate the fact that utility
fields |u.V|, |v.V|, and |w.A| of each vertex will be set, because those
utility fields are pointers from the new graph to the original graph.
The |save_graph| procedure does not deal with pointers between graphs.

@* Graph products. Three ways have traditionally been used to define the
product of two graphs. In all three cases the vertices of the product graph
are ordered pairs $(v,v')$, where $v$ and $v'$ are vertices of the original
graphs; the difference occurs in the definition of arcs. Suppose $g$ has
$m$ arcs and $n$ vertices, while $g'$ has $m'$ arcs and $n'$ vertices. The
{\sl cartesian product\/} of $g$ and~$g'$ has $mn'+m'n$ arcs, namely from
$(u,u')$ to $(v,u')$ whenever there's an arc from $u$ to $v$ in~$g$, and from
$(u,u')$ to $(u,v')$ whenever there's an arc from $u'$ to $v'$ in~$g'$.
The {\sl direct product\/} has $mm'$ arcs, namely from $(u,u')$ to
$(v,v')$ in the same circumstances. The {\sl strong product\/}
has both the arcs of the cartesian product and the direct product.

Notice that an undirected graph with $m$ edges has $2m$ arcs. Thus the
number of edges in the direct product of two undirected graphs is
twice the product of the number of edges in the individual graphs.
A self-loop in~$g$ will combine with an edge in~$g'$ to make
two parallel edges in the direct product.

The subroutine call |product(g,gg,type,directed)| produces the product
graph of one of these three types, where |type=0| for cartesian product,
|type=1| for direct product, and |type=2| for strong product.
The length of an arc in the cartesian product is copied from the length
of the original arc that it replicates; the length of an arc in the direct
product is the minimum of the two arc lengths that induce it. If |directed=0|,
the product graph will be an undirected graph with edges consisting
of consecutive arc pairs according to the standard GraphBase conventions,
and the input graphs should adhere to  the same conventions.

@* Induced graphs. Another important way to transform a graph is to
remove, identify, or split some of its vertices. All of these
operations are performed by the |induced| routine, which users can
invoke by calling `|induced(g,description,self,multi,directed)|'.

Each vertex |v| of |g| should first be assigned an ``induction code'' in
its field |v->ind|, which is actually utility field~|z|. The
induction code is 0~if |v| is to be eliminated; it is 1~if |v| is to be
retained; it is |k>1| if |v| is to be split into $k$ nonadjacent vertices
having the same neighbors as~|v| did; and it is |k<0| if |v| is to be
identified with all other vertices having the same value of~|k|.

For example, suppose |g| is a circuit with vertices $\{0,1,\ldots,9\}$,
where |j| is adjacent to~|k| if and only if $k=(j\pm1)\bmod10$.
If we set
$$\vcenter{\halign{\hbox{\hfil#\hfil}\cr
|0->ind=0|,\quad |1->ind=5->ind=9->ind=-1|,\quad |2->ind=3->ind=-2|,\cr
|4->ind=6->ind=8->ind=1|,\quad and |7->ind=3|,\cr}}$$
the induced graph will have vertices $\{-1,-2,4,6,7,7',7'',8\}$.
The vertices adjacent to 6, say, will be $-1$ (formerly~5), 7, $7'$,
and~$7''$. The vertices adjacent to $-1$ will be those formerly
adjacent to 1, 5, or~9, namely $-2$ (formerly~2), 4, 6, and~8. The
vertices adjacent to $-2$ will be those formerly adjacent to 2 or~3,
namely $-1$ (formerly~1), $-2$ (formerly~3), $-2$ (formerly~2), and~4.
Duplicate edges will be discarded if |multi==0|, and self-loops will
be discarded if |self==0|.

The total number of vertices in the induced graph will be the sum
of the positive |ind| fields plus the absolute value of the most
negative |ind| field. This rule implies, for example, that if at least
one vertex has |ind=-5|, the induced graph will always have a vertex $-4$,
even though no |ind| field has been set to~$-4$.

The |description| parameter is a string that will appear as part of
the name of the induced graph; if |description=0|, this string will
be empty. In the latter case, users are encouraged to assign a suitable
name to the |id| field of the induced graph themselves, characterizing
the method by which the |ind| codes were set.

If the |directed| parameter is zero, the input graph will be assumed to
be undirected, and the output graph will be undirected.

When |multi=0|, the length of an arc that represents multiple arcs
will be the minimum of the multiple arc lengths.

@d ind z.I

@(gb_basic.h@>=
#define ind @[z.I /* utility field |z| when used to induce a graph */@]

@ Here's a simple example: To get a complete bipartite graph with
parts of sizes |n1| and |n2|, we can start with a trivial two-point
graph and split its vertices into |n1| and |n2| parts.

@<Applications...@>=
Graph *bi_complete(n1,n2,directed)
  unsigned long n1; /* size of first part */
  unsigned long n2; /* size of second part */
  long directed; /* should all arcs go from first part to second? */
{@+Graph *new_graph=board(2L,0L,0L,0L,1L,0L,directed);
  if (new_graph) {
    new_graph->vertices->ind=n1;
    (new_graph->vertices+1)->ind=n2;
    new_graph=induced(new_graph,NULL,0L,0L,directed);
    if (new_graph) {
      sprintf(new_graph->id,"bi_complete(%lu,%lu,%d)",@|
                              n1,n2,directed?1:0);
      mark_bipartite(new_graph,n1);
    }
  }
  return new_graph;
}

@ The |induced| routine also provides a special feature not mentioned
above: If the |ind| field of any vertex |v| is |IND_GRAPH| or greater
(where |IND_GRAPH| is a large constant, much larger than the number
of vertices that would fit in computer memory), then utility field |v->subst|
should point to a graph. A copy of the vertices of
that graph will then be substituted for |v| in the induced graph.

This feature extends the ordinary case when |v->ind>0|, which essentially
substitutes an empty graph for~|v|.

If substitution is being used to replace all of $g$'s vertices
by disjoint copies of some other graph~$g'$,
the induced graph will be somewhat similar to
a product graph. But it will not be the same as any of the three
types of output produced by |product|, because the relation between
$g$ and $g'$ is not symmetrical. Assuming that no self-loops are
present, and that graphs $(g,g')$ have respectively $(m,m')$ arcs and
$(n,n')$ vertices, the result of substituting $g'$ for all
vertices of~$g$ has $m'n+mn'^2$ arcs.

@ For example, we can use the |IND_GRAPH| feature to create a

more center points. In the directed case, the arcs will run from the
center(s) to a cycle; in the undirected case, the edges will join the
center(s) to a circuit.

@ The negative vertices get the negative number as their name. Split vertices
get names with an optional prime appended, if the |ind| field is 2;
otherwise split vertex names are obtained by appending a colon and an index
number between |0| and~|ind-1|. The name of a vertex within a
graph |v->subst| is composed of the name of |v| followed by a
colon and the name within that graph.

We store the original |ind| field in the |mult| field of the first
corresponding vertex in the new graph, and change |ind| to point to
that vertex. This convention makes it easy
to determine the location of each vertex's clone or clones.
Of course, if the original |ind| field is zero, we leave it zero (|NULL|),
because it has no corresponding vertex in the new graph.

@ The heart of the procedure to construct an induced graph is, of course,
the part where we map the arcs of |g| into arcs of |new_graph|.

Notice that if |v| has a self-loop
in the original graph and if |v| is being split into several vertices,
it will produce arcs between different clones of itself, but it will not
produce self-loops unless |self!=0|. In an undirected graph, a loop
from a vertex to itself will not produce multiple edges among its clones,
even if |multi!=0|.

More precisely, if |v| has |k| clones |u| through |u+k-1|, an original
directed arc from |v| to~|v| will generate all $k^2$ possible arcs between
them, except that the |k| self-loops will be eliminated when
|self==0|.  An original undirected edge from |v| to~|v| will generate
$k\choose2$ edges between distinct clones, together with |k|
undirected self-loops if |self!=0|.
