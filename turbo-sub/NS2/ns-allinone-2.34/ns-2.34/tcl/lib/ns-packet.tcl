#
# XXX Packet Header Usage Guide
#
# By default, ns includes ALL packet headers of ALL protocols in ns in 
# EVERY packet in your simulation. This is a LOT, and will increase as more
# protocols are added into ns. For "packet-intensive" simulations, this could
# be a huge overhead.
#
# To include only the packet headers that are of interest to you in your 
# specific simulation, follow this pattern (e.g., you want to remove AODV,
# and ARP headers from your simulation):
#
#   remove-packet-header AODV ARP
#   ...
#   set ns [new Simulator]
#
# NOTICE THAT ADD-PACKET-HEADER{} MUST GO BEFORE THE SIMULATOR IS CREATED.
#
# To include only a specific set of headers in your simulation, e.g., AODV
# and ARP, follow this pattern:
#
#   remove-all-packet-headers
#   add-packet-header AODV ARP
#   ... 
#   set ns [new Simulator]
#
# IMPORTANT: You MUST never remove common header from your simulation. 
# As you can see, this is also enforced by these header manipulation procs.
#
