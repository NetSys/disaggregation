This is a brief description of the tests in the file
test-suite-session.tcl.  These tests can be run with the
command "./test-all-session".

Session1:
	Test one session on a simple topology.
                     n3
                    /
       1.5Mb,10ms  / 1.5Mb,10ms
    n0 --------- n1
                  \  1.5Mb,10ms
                   \
                    n2
	Events:                         
	time = 0.3, a CBR source at n2 starts sending to group 0x8001
	time = 0.3, four LossMonitor receivers, sitting at n0, n1, n2, and 
		n3 respectively, join the group 0x8001
	time = 1.1, simulation ends and prints number of packets 
		received/lost at the receivers

	test-output-Session1.Z:
	This is the compressed Test/Session1 output trace, generated by 
	'namtrace-all' command.  This command should capture the details of
	packets being duplicated/scheduled by sources and received by 
	receivers. 


Session2:
	Test one session on a six-node topology

                  n0
                 /  \
               n1    n2
              /  \  /  \
             n3   n4   n5

	All links are of 1.5Mbps bandwidth with 10ms latency

	Events:
	time = 0.1, CBR source at n0 starts
	time = 0.2, LossMonitor receivers at n0-n5 join group 0x8002
	time = 1.6, Simulation ends and prints #pkts received/lost at the 
		receivers 
           
	test-output-Session2.Z:
	This is the compressed Test/Session2 output trace, generated by 
	'namtrace-all' command.  This command should capture the details of
	packets being duplicated/scheduled by sources and received by 
	receivers. 

Session3:
	Test one session on a six node topology with inserted errors

                  n0
                 /  \
               n1    n2
              /  \  /  \
             n3   n4   n5

	All links are of 1.5Mbps bandwidth with 10ms latency

	Events:
	t=0, Loss module with 1-loss/20-packet rate is inserted in between 
		n0 and n1
	t=0, Loss module with 1-loss/10-packet rate is inserted in between 
		n1 and n3
	t=0, Loss module with 1-loss/10-packet rate is inserted in between 
		n0 and n2
	The rest is the same as Session2

	test-output-Session3.Z:
	This is the compressed Test/Session3 output trace, generated by 
	'namtrace-all' command.  This command should capture the details of
	packets being duplicated/scheduled by sources and received/lost at  
	receivers.
