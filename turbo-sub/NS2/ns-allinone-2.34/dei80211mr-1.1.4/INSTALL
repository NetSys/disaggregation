How to install the dei80211mr module:

-------------
 Quick start
-------------

1) you need a ns-allinone installation which has been patched for
   dynamic libraries. For further info, see this webpage:
   http://www.dei.unipd.it/~baldo/ns_dl_patch/ns_dl_patch.html	

2) assuming that you have ns-allinone installed in PATH, 
   run './configure  --with-ns-allinone=PATH', optionally using
   '--prefix=/my/prefix' if you intend to run 'make install' (see
   details below)  

3) run 'make'

4) if you configured with --prefix, or if you are allowed to install
   files to the default prefix (usually /usr/local), you can type 'make install'

 More details
--------------

1) ns-allinone

ns-allinone is required to build the dei80211mr module. 
You are expected to specify the path to the ns-allinone installation
using the --with-ns-allinone options to './configure'.

Current version was tested with ns 2.29 and 2.31. Please note that you
must not only unpack the ns-allinone source and patch it, but also run
'install'. This is because the install process places some header
files in 'ns-allinone-2.29/include' which are needed to build the
dei80211mr module.



2) I just built the library with 'make'. Where the hell is it???

After you run 'make', you can find both static (.a) and shared (.so)
libraries in 'lib/.libs' (the .libs subdir is automatically added by
libtool). Static libraries are almost useless, since they cannot be
loaded directly for NS simulation (you can disable their build by
passing --disable-static to ./configure).
If you run 'make install', all libraries are by default installed in
/usr/local/lib. Since in many systems installing in that path requires
root privileges, you might want to specify a different path, by using
either the '--prefix' or '--libdir' switch. Please run './configure
--help' for further info
.

3) Test suites

Some test routines are provided, which can be built and run routines
with 'make check'.

As of April 2007, a tutorial is being written which explains how to
install, among other things, ns-allinone with the patch for dynamic
libraries and the dei80211mr library.
