Following tcl files are ns-scripts for Directed Research with Dr.Heidemann. 
You could see the explanation about those files 
at http://www-scf.usc.edu/~hyunahpa/D-Research/DR-home.html 

All of the files which are using slidingwindow protocol are not
actually executing when users run it, instead it run old nam trace
file which are made before. 

There are 3 kinds of files per each mechanism, which are xx.tcl, xx.nam, and xx.tr.

All of the scripts whose file name start with 'A#- ' have same configuration, which
has 2 nodes and 1 link between them like this..
