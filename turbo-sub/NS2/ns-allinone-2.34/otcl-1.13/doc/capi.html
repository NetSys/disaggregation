<h1><a href="../README.html">OTcl</a> C API (Version 0.96, September 95)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This reference page describes the C application programmer
interface (API) for manipulating OTcl classes and objects. See <a
href="../otclAppInit.c">otclAppInit.c</a> for an example of a
<tt>Timer</tt> class written in C; <tt>Timer</tt> is included in the
shells if the symbol <tt>TESTCAPI</tt> is defined.</p>

<p>OTcl's C API is designed to complement the OTcl language in much
the same way that Tcl allows commands written in C to be added to an
interpreter. It is a minimal interface, suitable for migrating methods
to C for performance, or for manipulating complex (ie. non-string)
data structures. It is not a general package for binding C++ classes
and methods to Tcl commands.</p>

<p>See the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> for an introduction to
Tcl-level programming in OTcl.</p>


<h2>Working with the C API</h2>

<p>To access the C API, include <tt>otcl.h</tt>. This header defines
the externally visible interfaces, including the data structures
required to use them.</p>

<h3>Object and Class Structures</h3>

<p>Objects and classes are always manipulated through pointers to
opaque structures:</p>

<blockquote><pre>struct OTclObject;
struct OTclClass;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Actually, you can cast a class pointer to an object pointer (since
all classes are objects too) with no ill-effects, but you shouldn't
need to.</p>

<p>Two utility functions convert string names to object and class
pointers:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
struct OTclObject*
OTclGetObject(Tcl_Interp* in, char* name);

struct OTclClass*
OTclGetClass(Tcl_Interp* in, char* name);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>These functions are useful for getting handles to <tt>Object</tt>
and <tt>Class</tt> (the system provided classes) for use in creating
new classes, etc.</p>

<p>Two utility functions convert clientdata to object and class
pointers:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
struct OTclObject*
OTclAsObject(Tcl_Interp* in, ClientData cd);

struct OTclClass*
OTclAsClass(Tcl_Interp* in, ClientData cd);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>These functions are useful within method definitions when you have
installed the method to pass the current object via the clientdata;
see the section on Methods below. They perform a safe cast.</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>OTcl is initialized for an interpreter with a standard module
initialization routine, called from an AppInit or through dynamic
loading.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
Otcl_Init(Tcl_Interp* in);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Calls through the C API must be arranged to occur after OTcl
initialization.</p>

<h2>Objects and Classes</h2>

<p>Objects and classes can be created and destroyed from C as well as
Tcl without distinction. That is, classes created in C can be
destroyed from Tcl, and vice versa.</p>

<h3>Creation</h3>

<p>Objects and classes are created in an interpreter through class
pointers. Use a pointer to <tt>Class</tt> to create a generic class,
and a pointer to <tt>Object</tt> to create a generic object.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
struct OTclObject* 
OTclCreateObject(Tcl_Interp* in, char* name, struct OTclClass* cl);

struct OTclClass*
OTclCreateClass(Tcl_Interp* in, char* name, struct OTclClass* cl);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Both calls are conceptually equivalent to <tt>"cl create name"</tt>
in Tcl, but return either a pointer value or <tt>NULL</tt> to indicate
failure.</p>

<h3>Deletion</h3>

<p>Object and classes are deleted from an interpreter through their
pointers.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
OTclDeleteObject(Tcl_Interp* in, struct OTclObject* obj);

int
OTclDeleteClass(Tcl_Interp* in, struct OTclClass* cl);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Both calls are conceptually equivalent to <tt>"obj destroy"</tt> or
<tt>"cl destroy"</tt>, and return a Tcl call code.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Methods can be added and combined from C as well as from Tcl
without distinction. For example, C methods can be called from Tcl
transparently, and C methods can combine with Tcl methods
automatically.</p>

<h3>Interface Conventions</h3>

<p>In terms of interface, methods are analogous to Tcl commands, with
two important differences.</p>

<ol>

<li>The argc/argv array is passed in "expanded form", having three extra
arguments. argv[0] contains the name of the object, just as Tcl's
first argument contains the name of the invoking command. The next
three arguments contain values for extra method context variables:
<tt>self</tt>, <tt>class</tt>, and <tt>proc</tt>. The remaining
arguments (argv[4] and higher) contain the arguments passed to the
method.

<li>The clientData may be used to obtain a pointer to the object on
behalf of which the method is being invoked. If the method was created
with a clientData of <tt>NULL</tt>, then the dispatcher fills the
clientData with an object pointer. Otherwise, the dispatcher passes
the specified clientData. To convert the clientData to an object or
class pointer, you can use the typed casting functions
<tt>OTclAsObject</tt> and <tt>OTclAsClass</tt>.

</ol>

<h3>Adding Methods</h3>

<p>Two functions add methods to objects and classes, serving as the C
equivalent of the <tt>proc</tt> and <tt>instproc</tt> methods. The
types of the last three arguments are the same as for Tcl
commands.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void
OTclAddPMethod(struct OTclObject* obj, char* nm, Tcl_CmdProc* proc,
	       ClientData cd, Tcl_CmdDeleteProc* dp);

void
OTclAddIMethod(struct OTclClass* cl, char* nm, Tcl_CmdProc* proc,
	       ClientData cd, Tcl_CmdDeleteProc* dp);
</pre></blockquote>


<h3>Removing Methods</h3>

<p>Two functions remove methods from objects and classes. If a
deleteProc callback was registered to clean up the method, then it is
passed the original non-NULL clientdata. If the original clientdata
was NULL, however, then a pointer to the object or class from which
the method is being removed is passed instead.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
OTclRemovePMethod(struct OTclObject* obj, char* nm);

int
OTclRemoveIMethod(struct OTclClass* cl, char* nm);
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Combining Methods</h3>

<p>An executing methods can be automatically combined with the
next-most specific method with the following function. It is
equivalent to <tt>"obj next ..args.."</tt>. argc/argv is passed in
expanded form, and should carry the context of the currently executing
method. It returns a Tcl return code.</p>
 
<blockquote><pre>
int
OTclNextMethod(struct OTclObject* obj, Tcl_Interp* in, int argc, char*argv[]);
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Instance Variables</h2>

<p>Tcl accessible instance variables (stored as strings) can be
manipulated from C. In addition, objects can store a handle to private
auxilliary data.</p>

<h3>*InstVar</h3>

<p>OTclSetInstVar, OTclGetInstVar, and OTclUnsetInstVar mimic
Tcl_SetVar, Tcl_GetVar, and Tcl_UnsetVar for instance variables. The
return values and codes for parameters such as <tt>flgs</tt> match Tcl
conventions.</p>
 
<blockquote><pre>
char*
OTclSetInstVar(struct OTclObject* obj, Tcl_Interp* in,
	       char* name, char* value, int flgs);
char*
OTclGetInstVar(struct OTclObject* obj, Tcl_Interp* in,
               char* name, int flgs);

int
OTclUnsetInstVar(struct OTclObject* obj, Tcl_Interp* in,
                 char* name, int flgs);
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Auxilliary Data</h3>

<p>OTclSetObjectData, OTclGetObjectData and OTclUnsetObjectData
manipulate private object clientdata, such as a pointer to an
auxilliary data region. ObjectData is a per object and per class
resource to allow for inheritance. Typically, it is manipulated on
behalf of the invoking object in each class method by using the
directly associated class. In this manner specializations of a class
may each store their own ObjectData.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
int
OTclGetObjectData(struct OTclObject* obj,struct OTclClass* cl,
		  ClientData* data);

void
OTclSetObjectData(struct OTclObject* obj, struct OTclClass* cl,
		  ClientData data);

int
OTclUnsetObjectData(struct OTclObject* obj, struct OTclClass* cl);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Get fills the <tt>data</tt> value passed by reference, and returns
<tt>0</tt> or <tt>1</tt> depending on whether the ObjectData
existed. If it didn't, then data is filled with <tt>NULL</tt>. Set
overwrites existing ObjectData without error. Unset returns <tt>0</tt>
or <tt>1</tt> depending on whether the ObjectData existed.</p>
