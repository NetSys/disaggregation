       <b>introduction</b><br>
       ( Here's the format )  a boldface set of keywords about what
       part of ns is relevant,
       text describing what's going on,
       then a signature and date.

  	<b>Multi-threading in auto layout</b> <br>


  <li>
  	<b>Autolayout on regions of a graph</b> <br>
	Now we have unified editview and normal views, users should be able to 
	specify a particular region, and do auto layout only in that region. 
	This would be useful in large graphs. The first step would be to add flags
	to nodes and to instruct auto layout to only work on marked nodes.
	<p>

  <li>
  	<b>Tree layout</b><br>
	If one knows that a topology is a tree, she/he should be able to specify
	the root of the tree, and nam will starting layout from that point, and put 
	all nodes at equal distance to the root on concentric circles. The first 
	step would be to spread all nodes at equal distance to the root evenly on 
	their circle. We can later optimize the algorithm to find a nice fanout 
	angle for every node based on the size of its subtree.

       <b>Wireless</b>
       Visualization of data flowing between wireless nodes . Showing the
        signal has been transmitted from some sender and received by the receiver

  <li>
       <b>Topology</b>
        The topology isn't scaled very well when nam starts up (nodes, links, or annotations may go off the visible screen, requiring you to horizontally scroll to see it all)

       <b>Queue</b>
       Queue occupancy indicator, when exceeding bounding box, scribbles on screen , sometimes hangs X sever .

  <li>
       <b>Labeling links</b>
       A more flexible way to label links (like: label above, below, or next to object, different colors and fonts for the labels)

  <li>
       <b>TCP</b>
        When turning off tcp_cong, the segments
        probably should not disappear, but instead
        revert back to the color of regular segments.  tcp_cong
        segments still are regular tcp segments, just
        that happen to be marked.
        it probably should work this way for ecn-echo
        acks also

       <b>TCP</b>
       Display grid lines in the seq# vs. time plot will be nice

  <li>
       <b>Link</b>
       Being able to control the displayed link and width of a link
       would be nice sometimes

      <p>

  <li>
       <b>TCP</b>
       It would be nice if one could highlight two points on the
       seq# vs time graph and have a little box tell you
       x and y axis deltas between them.  That is, you could
       highlight, say, a packet and its ack and it would tell you
       how many seconds they are apart.  Or, you could highlight
       two forward segments and it would tell you how many
       sequence numbers and secs there are between them.
       would be nice sometimes

  <li>
       <b>chrome</b>
       Is there a way to hit a key which will forward the animation
       time slider to the point a new src/dest pair is seen in the trace?

  <li>
       <b>TCP packet</b>
       It would be really cool if one could arrange to have the
       next packet after a dropped packet turn a different color.
       In this way, one can illustrate the amount of time needed
       for a tcp to "learn" that a packet has been dropped.  It helps
       to illustrate that the tcp need wait not only the min RTT, but
       also the amount of time to drain the queue where this (packet
       after the dropped one) is queued.

      <p>

  <li>
       <b>goodput</b>
       A measure of goodput over the time range would be nice.
       it would be especially cool if when you zoom in to a
       region you get goodput measures averaged over that particular
        region you zoomed in on.

      <p>

  <li>
       <b>RED queue</b>
       It would be very cool if, for RED queues, one could have a sort
       of little thermometer indicating the average queue size, the
       ewma gain constant, whether it was marking or dropping, and
       maxprob in addition to little marks on it indicating maxth and minth

  <li>
       <b>Queue</b>
       Some sort of box that would compute a fairness index
       (say, from Jain p.36) at a queue might be useful in illustrating
       the behavior of say FQ or DRR

  <li> <b>Asymmetric links</b>: Nam supports symmetric links and simplex links 
	only, it does not support asymmetric link, i.e., two simplex links 
	attached to the same two nodes but with different bandwidth and/or 
	delay. This is a design fault inherent in manual layout and auto-layout
	and correcting it probably requires changing these two parts.

  <p>
  <li> <b>Labeling links</b>: Currently the only way to label a link
  is to use link color. It would be good to allow add dynamic textual
  labels to links, in the same way as they are added to nodes. This
  would only require two (quite straightforward) modifications: (1)
  add an extra field in 
  the link trace line to indicate the label, and (2) display the label
  in Edge::draw().

  <li>
       <b>annotations</b>
       Should be able to label packets with arbitrary strings.

  <p>
  <li>
       <b>dynamics</b>
 I'd like to be able to create/remove nodes (not necessarily
  wireless) on the fly (so that I could pipe surveyor output directly
  to nam and create new nodes as surveyor discovers them).
       <em>(<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~yuri/">[yuri]</a>

  <li>
       <b>chrome</b>
       Would be nice to be able to add arrows to the links (as an option)
  to see if this link is unidirection/bi-directional.  I suppose this
  should be very easy to do.
       <em>(<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~yuri/">[yuri]</a>
       before Thu Jun 17 18:04:37 PDT 1999)</em>
       <br> All links in nam is bi-directional. So this is not an
       option, I think. -haoboy.

         <p>
  <li>
       <b>customization, interactivity</b>
Now when I click on a link or node a window appears which holds
  BW/delay information for the link and a node number for the node.
  It would be great if a user had more control over the contents of
  this window.  For example, when I click on a link I'd like to see IP
  addresses of the endpoints (for a router typically has several
  ifaces); and when I click at a node, I'd like to see some
  information about the node, e.g. it's distance from current
  surveyors).

         <p>
  <li>
       <b>chrome</b>
       Finally, changing/removing node labels (inside node circles) could
       be useful.
       <em>(<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~yuri/">[yuri]</a>
       before Thu Jun 17 18:04:37 PDT 1999)</em>
       <p>
       Can't this be done already with text node labels (the ones
       beneath the nodes?).   --johnh
       <p>
       
       The visual effect of this can be quite ugly though. Imagine a
       200 node graph with a 12-digit IP address in each of the
       node. The right way to do this is perhaps to allow users to
       toggle showing the current textual labels either UNDER a node,
       or INSIDE a node's pane when clicked. -haoboy
       <p>
  <li>
       <b>parsing, cruft</b>
Another thing with is sort of related is the parsing code.
Currently there's a lot of hand-written code in trace.cc
switch big switch statements and lots of atoi stuff
and rudimentory error checking (did I get > 2 fields?)

       <p>
It might be lot easier to maintin/add to this code if there was some
kind of table-driven parser something like getopt for argc/argv,
or like widget parsing in X11.

  <p>
  <li>
       <b>annotations</b>
An artifact, not a bug: I just realised that nam does not
show multiple simultaneously occurring annotations in its
annotations window.  This appears counter-intuitive.  As an
example, see http://www.isi.edu/~kannan/out-cmcast.nam.

       <p>
The annotations show only node 0 joining group 65520.  In
reality, all nodes in the topology join this group at the
same time, at startup.  Seeing only one line made me believe
there was a strange bug in my code, when it turns out to be
an artifact of nam.  It would be nice if this were fixed in
some way, and otherwise documented someplace.

       <p>
(One suggestion is that for subsequent simultaneous
annotations, an single annotation line be added as "0 others".
 A popup menu on that line could show other annotations when
requested, but that is getting more featureful than I need
for my requirements. :-)
