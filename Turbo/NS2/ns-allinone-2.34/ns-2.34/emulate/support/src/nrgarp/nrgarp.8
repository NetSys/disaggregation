.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address translation
tables used by the address resolution protocol
.Pq Xr arp 4 .
With no flags, the program displays the current
.Tn ARP
entry for
.Ar hostname .
The host may be specified by name or by number,
using Internet dot notation.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
The program displays or deletes all of the current
.Tn ARP
entries.
.It Fl d
A super-user may delete an entry for the host called
.Ar hostname
with the
.Fl d
flag.
.It Fl n
Show network addresses as numbers (normally
.Nm
attempts to display addresses symbolically).
.It Fl s Ar hostname ether_addr
Create an
.Tn ARP
entry for the host called
.Ar hostname
with the Ethernet address 
.Ar ether_addr .
The Ethernet address is given as six hex bytes separated by colons.
The entry will be permanent unless the word
.Ar temp
is given in the command. 
If the word
.Ar pub
is given, the entry will be "published"; i.e., this system will
act as an
.Tn ARP
server,
responding to requests for 
.Ar hostname
even though the host address is not its own.
In this case the ether_addr can be given as `auto''
in which case the interfaces on this host will be examined,
and if one of them is found to occupy the same subnet, its
ether_addr will be used.
If the word
.Ar ifname
is given, the mapping will only be installed on the specified interface.
.It Fl S Ar hostname ether_addr
Is just like
.Fl s
except any existing arp entry for this host will be deleted first.
.It Fl f
Causes the file
.Ar filename
to be read and multiple entries to be set in the
.Tn ARP
tables.  Entries
in the file should be of the form
.Pp
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Ar hostname ether_addr
.Op Ar temp
.Op Ar pub
.Op Ar ifname
.Ed
.Pp
with argument meanings as given above.

.Sh HISTORY
The
arp
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
The extension was developed by Kevin Fall at LBNL for
use with the ns simulator in emulation mode in 9/1998.
