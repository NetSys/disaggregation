Description: 
------------
dosreduce creates a reduced network topology from 
a larger inet topolgy based on intersection of attacker and 
crosstraffic paths. The nodes and links that donot intersect 
with the attack tree are pruned to create a reduced network 
topology.

Input:
----- 
dosreduce accepts the network topology in an inet topology file 
and the number of attackers and active crosstraffic connections 
at the command line.

Output:
------
Based on the intersection of the attack tree and crosstraffic paths,
it outputs the attacker and victim nodes and required nodes and links
in the reduced topology.  

Usage:
------
dosreduce inet_topology #attackers #activeconnections
