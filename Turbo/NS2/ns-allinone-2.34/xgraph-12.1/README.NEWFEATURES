This code is essentially XGraph release 11.4, with some modifications
which were made for use by the NCSA Relativity group.
These modifications were made by Paul Walker, and he should be
contacted at the below address if you have any problems/questions
regarding these features.

1.	Animation.  XGraph will now do a *very* crude animation of
	your data sets.  It occasionally has problems with refreshes
	and will consequently run your animation three of four times.
	Consider this an undocumented feature!  You can adjust the
	speed of the animation with the -dl option.  I find "2" works
	well on a sparc displaying on MacX, "5" on a sparc on its
	own display, and "10" on an SGI or RS6K on its own display.
	Remeber, this animation is not being advertised as anything
	other than very crude, so if you are looking for production
	quality video, turn elsewhere.  We find it useful as it will
	quickly generate animation which shows time evolution. 

2.	Differentation.  You can press the "Derivative" button to
	see the first and second derivatives of your data set.  The
	method is a standard centered difference.  You cannot display
	higher than second derivatives.  Animation, zooming, etc...
	work in each of the derivative windows.  Endpoints are found
	linearly interpolating inner values to ends, so pay them
	little heed!

3.	New Color Map.  We couldn't differentiate the colors once we
	got past yellow, so we created a new color map.  If you don't
	like it, look in init.c for the variable "defColors" and 
	comment out the new one, replacing it with the commented
	old one.  Of course, you are free to insert your own choices
	here also ... Just use standard X color names.
