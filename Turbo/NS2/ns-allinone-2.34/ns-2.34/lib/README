The code in this directory is from libg++,
either copied directly (builtin.h),
or derived with genclass (everything else).

If you genclass new classes, 
please
	(1) make sure they don't use any gcc-isms
	(2) comment out #include <stream> and replace
		the "cerr <<" statement in the default error handler
		with fprintf (ns doesn't use streams, just printf)


Current classes:
int.Vec:      arrays of integers (with bounds checking and helpers)
int.RVec:     auto-resizing arrays of integers
