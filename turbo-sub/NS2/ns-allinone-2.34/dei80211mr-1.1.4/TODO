TODO LIST

- channel sensing  should be performed with respect to
  power+interference, not power only. Suppose our node sees several
  transmissions from users which are very far, and that the received
  power we see separately from each is below the sensing threshold. If
  the sum of all these powers is above the sensing threshold, the
  receiver should attempt reception (which will likely fail), and the
  channel should be sensed busy so that we don't start transmission in
  this case. 
  NOTE: porting dei80211mr to MPhy would allow an easy solution


- Validate new idle timeslot counter (idle2slots) and eventually
  remove the old, buggy one (idleslots)	 

- in order to be coherent with the 802.11 standard, we should change
  the current CWmin/max implementation (which anyway provides correct
  behaviour) so that CWmin and CWmax are 31 and 1023 respectively (not 32
  and 1024).

- should check if PER interface is  suitable for
  extensions and/or re-implementation of the module

- Fix indentation style

- Add comments, especially in header files

- check and eventually remove old code which has been commented out
