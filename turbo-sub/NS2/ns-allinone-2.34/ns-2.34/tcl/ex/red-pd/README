Requirements:

1. Make sure you have the following binaries in your PATH variable
	1. ns 
	2. gnuplot
	3. gv
	4. awk
	5. grep
	6. sort

2. perl is installed in /usr/bin/perl 

3. csh is installed in /bin/csh

4. If you are running from a remote machine, the DISPLAY variable should be set correctly (for popping up the graphs automatically).

If any of the first 3 requirements are not met, you will have to modify the scripts in the right places.

Instructions for running the simulations are relative to the version of the RED-PD paper at http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ratul/red-pd/paper_quals.ps 
The working directory is assumed to be ~ns/tcl/ex/red-pd
The commands shown below assume that all files ending in '.sh' and '.pl' are executable (can be made so using chmod +x <filename>). If that is not the case run 'file.sh' and 'file.pl' using  'csh file.sh' and 'perl file.pl' respectively.

As a result of running the scripts, the graphs will be created as postscript files in the appropriate directories. They will also pop up automatically at the end of simulation.
