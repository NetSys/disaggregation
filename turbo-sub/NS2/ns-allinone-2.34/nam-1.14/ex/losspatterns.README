Tracefile: losspatterns.nam

This animation shows the loss distribution in an Mbone session over
time.  Color indicates the loss on a particular link as follows:

  red: loss > 10%
  orange: 2% < loss <= 10%
  brown: 0% < loss <= 2%
  black: no loss
  blue: possible duplication

The data was gathered using mtrace by monitoring RTCP session
messages, and periodically initiating an mtrace from every current
receiver back to the data source.  The data source in this case was
node 0, which is sending audio to the Mbone session "KWAX Classical
Radio" between 14:30 and 18:30 on Tuesday 17th Feb 1998.

When one set of mtraces finish a new set are initiated, which results
in us sampling the loss about every 3 to 4 minutes.  Where multiple
mtraces include the same link in the same interval, the number of
received packets and number of lost packets are added, so towards the
sender, results tend to be based on more data and longer averages than
towards the receivers.

Frequently links and nodes grey out - this indicates that either the
receiver left the group (which was rare) or the mtrace failed.  

The reason for performing this monitoring was to get some kind of
indication of how stable loss points are over time - whether the
points of congestion move around or not.  

For those interested, the mapping from node number to IP address is
given below.
