Each zip file contains a number of log files. Each log file describes one job. Each job log contains one line about each task in the job. Fields should largely be self explanatory; for questions contact Kay Ousterhout.

The "tpcds" files contain traces from a TPC-DS variant that includes 20 queries from the TPC-DS benchmark.  The "bdb" files contain traces from the big data benchmark (amplab.berkeley.edu/benchmark). Files labeled "memory" storeinput and output data in-memory; files labeled "disk" store input and output data on-disk, triply replicated using HDFS.
