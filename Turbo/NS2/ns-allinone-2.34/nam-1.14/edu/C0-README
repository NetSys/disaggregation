FILE NAME	 	DESCRIPTION

C0-README		This file

In C1-slow-start and C2-sliding-window, the network parameters are changing to set the environment where the network bandwidth is not fixed like in the Internet.

C1-slow-start		It shows how TCP can transmit its data in the Internet environment
			feature	: label, annotation, nam-graph, and cwnd monitor
			  	  To see nam-graph, click 'Active Sessions' under 
                          	  'Analysis' in the nam menu, then click 'TCP session' 

C2-sliding-window	It shows how Sliding window acts in the Internet environment
                        feature : label, annotation, nam-graph, and cwnd monitor
                                  To see nam-graph, click 'Active Sessions' under
                                  'Analysis' in the nam menu, then click 'TCP session'

C2-sliding-color	Same as C2-sliding-window but it doesn't provide nam-graph
                        to support coloring. 
                        Use "syn" option in nam menu to see both of them simultaneously

In C3-slow-start and C4-sliding-window, the network parameters are not changing. 

C3-slow-start		It shows how TCP can transmit its data in a fixed environment
			feature	: label, annotation, nam-graph, and cwnd monitor
			  	  To see nam-graph, click 'Active Sessions' under 
                          	  'Analysis' in the nam menu, then click 'TCP session' 

C4-sliding-window	It shows how Sliding window acts in a fixed environment
                        feature : label, annotation, nam-graph, and cwnd monitor
                                  To see nam-graph, click 'Active Sessions' under
                                  'Analysis' in the nam menu, then click 'TCP session'

C4-sliding-color	Same as C4-sliding-window but it doesn't provide nam-graph
                        to support coloring. 
                        Use "syn" option in nam menu to see both of them simultaneously
