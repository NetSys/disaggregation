  abstract =	 "This article describes the Dynamic Prefix Tries - a
                  novel data structure with algorithms for insertion,
                  deletion and retrieval to build and maintain a
                  dynamic database of binary keys of arbitrary
                  length. These tries extend the concepts of compact
                  digital (Patricia) tries to support the storage of
                  prefixes and to guarantee retrieval times at most
                  linear in the length of the input key irrespective
                  of the trie size, even when searching for
                  longest-matching prefixes. The new design permits
                  very efficient, simple and non-recursive
                  implementations of small code size and minimal
                  storage requirements. Insert and delete operations
                  have strictly local effects, and their particular
                  sequence is irrelevant for the structure of the
                  resulting trie, thus maintaining at all times the
                  desired storage and computational efficiency. The
                  algorithms have been successfully employed in
                  experimental communication systems and products for
                  a variety of networking functions such as address

  abstract =	 "This paper examines the network inter-domain routing
                  information exchanged between backbone service
                  providers at the major U.S. public Internet exchange
                  points. Internet routing instability, or the rapid
                  fluctuation of network reachability information, is
                  an important problem currently facing the Internet
                  engineering community. High levels of network
                  instability can lead to packet loss, increased
                  network latency and time to convergence. At the
                  extreme, high levels of routing instability have
                  lead to the loss of internal connectivity in
                  wide-area, national networks.  In this paper, we
                  describe several unexpected trends in routing
                  instability, and examine a number of anomalies and
                  pathologies observed in the exchange of inter-domain
                  routing information.  The analysis in this paper is
                  based on data collected from BGP routing messages
                  generated by border routers at five of the Internet
                  core's public exchange points during a nine month
                  period.  We show that the volume of these routing
                  updates is several orders of magnitude more than
                  expected and that the majority of this routing
                  information is redundant, or
                  pathological. Furthermore, our analysis reveals
                  several unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic
                  properties in Internet routing.  We finally posit a
                  number of explanations for these anomalies and
                  evaluate their potential impact on the Internet

	ABSTRACT="The bridge algorithm adopted by the IEEE 802.1
		  committee for interconnecting 802 LANs requires the
		  topology of the extended LAN to be a spanning tree. A
		  distributed algorithm to compute a spanning tree
		  dynamically has already been published and adopted by
		  the IEEE 802.1 committee. In this paper, however, we
		  describe an alternative distributed spanning tree
		  algorithm. This algorithm, variants of which have
		  been implemented, initially appears simpler than the
		  IEEE 802.1 algorithm; we show, however, that it has
		  subtle failure modes that make it unattractive in
		  practice. We also show some failure modes of the
		  spanning tree algorithm introduced in this paper are
		  characteristic of a broader class of distributed
		  graph algorithms. Such algorithms potentially examine
		  all possible path combinations between a source and a
		  destination in a graph. Thus, they suffer from
		  exponential message overhead in topologies that have
		  an exponential number of paths between source and
		  destination. Attempts to fix this problem lead to
		  extra complexity (in terms of CPU, bandwidth, memory)
		  when compared to other algorithms. We briefly
		  describe a second example belonging to this class,
		  and propose that designers avoid such algorithms if
		  restricting the topology or scale of the network is
		  unacceptable.",

	SUMMARY="The paper describes a design process of developing an
                  algorithm that bridges in a LAN can use to compute
                  spanning trees.  The algorithm must be reliable,
                  robust, and deal with differetn topologies, and
                  failure modes. The paper is more interesting for the
                  design process methodology than the actual
