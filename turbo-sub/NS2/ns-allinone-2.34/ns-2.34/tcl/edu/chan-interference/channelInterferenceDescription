Channel Interference
--------------------

The problem of Interference occurs "when a receiver is in range of one transmitting station
and slightly out-of-range of another transmitting station, but is unable to cleanly receive
the closer station's signal because of the interfering presence of the other signal."

In our animation, we show 2 cases :

Case 1:
-------

When 2 nodes are in range of each other 
When these 2 nodes do carrier sense at different times, they detect carrier and the node
that senses carrier later, backs off, thus avoiding collision at the receiver.
But if the 2 nodes do carrier sense at the same time, they are not able to detect carrier
and hence there is a collision at the receiver.

Case 2 :
-------

When 1 node is slightly out of range of the other
In this case, when both nodes send data to the receiver, some of the packets sent by the node
closer to the receiver get dropped, because the receiver receives some packets from the node
slightly out of range.
