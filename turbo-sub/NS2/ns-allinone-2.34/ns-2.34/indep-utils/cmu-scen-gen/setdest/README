A.scenario or node-movement file generator
---------------------------
Directory:
~ns/indep-utils/cmu-scen-gen/setdest

Files:
Makefile
setdest.h setdest.cc
make-scen.csh


Steps for creating scenario files for mobility simulations :

1. Go to ns directory and run "configure" (you probably have done that
already while building ns). This creates a makefile for setdest. 

2.Go to indep-utils/cmu-scen-gen/setdest. Run "make" , which first creates
a stand-alone object file for ~ns/rng.cc (the stand-alone version doesnot
use Tclcl libs) and then creates the executable setdest. 

3. Run setdest with arguments as shown below: ./setdest [-v version of setdest; 1 for original 1999 CMU version or 2 for modified 2003 U.Michigan version ] [-n num_of_nodes] [-p pausetime] [-s maxspeed] [-t simtime] [-x maxx] [-y maxy] > [outdir/movement-file]
 
Example: ./setdest -v 1 -n 20 -p 2.0 -s 10.0 -t 200 -x 500 -y 500 >
scen-20-test
and the output will be written in a file called scen-20-test.

4a. OR run make-scen.csh to generate multiple scenario files.
